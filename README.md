# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hi, my name is Jenna and I'm a third year Data Science student at the University of Georgia. I am interested in machine learning and automation. Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to gain exposure to machine learning techniques through my coursework. I am always enthusiatic about learning more!

In addition to the information on this Github Page, access to my previous project experience is available on my linkedIn Page which is located at www.linkedin.com/in/jennaodom.

Thank you for your interest in my work,

Jenna Odom
